# Introduction

Simple Twitter is a minimalist social media application designed to provide users with a straightforward platform to share short messages and follow others.

## Key Features

**User Features**:
- **Authentication**: Users can sign up for a new account or log in to an existing one.
- **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile page displaying their tweets, replies, and liked tweets.
- **Profile Editing**: Users can edit their personal information, including name, introduction, avatar, and background image.
- **Tweeting & Engagement**: Users can create & post new tweets. They can also reply to and like tweets from other users.
- **Following System**: Users can follow and unfollow other users to customize their social network.
- **Timeline**: The main page displays a timeline of all users' tweets.

**Admin Features**:
- **Independent Entry**: A separate login and web page for administrators to manage the platform.
- **Tweet Management**: Administrators can view all tweets posted by users and have the ability to delete any tweet.
- **User Management**: Administrators can view a list of all registered users on the platform.

## Technical Insights

- **Component Architecture**: Extracted reusable <b>React</b> components from design draft to ensure consistency and maintainability.
- **Clean Styling**: Used <b>Styled Components</b> for modular and reusable CSS-in-JS styling in React components.
- **State Management**: Managed complex state across multiple components using <b>React's Context API</b>.
- **API Integration**: Used <b>Axios</b> to handle HTTP requests to the backend server for user authentication, tweet management, and profile updates.
- **Routing**: Implemented <b>React Router</b> for navigation between different pages and user profiles.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Team Coordination**:
  - **Challenge**: Team members have different schedules, making it hard to gather everyone to discuss project details frequently.
  - **Solution**: Utilize Agile development practices, including daily stand-ups and sprint planning meetings, to ensure effective communication and collaboration.
- **Backend API Document**:
  - **Challenge**: Frontend engineers must wait for backend engineers to complete the API features before they can start development.
  - **Solution**: Use Postman to align API documentation with backend engineers, allowing frontend engineers to start development in parallel.

## Outcome

- Delivered a responsive front-end with ~18 reusable React components, reducing style/markup duplication by ~35%.
- Established a shared API spec (Postman collection), enabling frontend to start ~3 days earlier than original plan.
- Implemented Context-based state to remove >20 prop-drilling paths and simplify maintenance.

This project strengthened my React component design, state management, and API integration collaboration skills, improving my ability to work in a multi-role team environment.
