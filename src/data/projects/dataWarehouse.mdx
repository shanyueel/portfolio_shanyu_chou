## Key Features

- **Data Visualization**: Engineered a dynamic data visualization dashboard, rendering complex business metrics into interactive charts and graphs, enabling users to intuitively analyze trends.
- **AI Recommendation**: Integrated chatGPT's API to surface AI-driven business recommendations within the user interface to help users trust and act upon the data-driven suggestions.
- **Analytics & Comparisons**: Implemented an analytics toolkit, featuring customizable date-range pickers and dynamic metric comparison, that allow users to perform analysis of metrics such as sales trends, customer behavior, and more.
- **Optimistic Interaction**: Implemented an achievement system for key metrics to provide positive, real-time feedback to users, enhancing user engagement and improving their sensitivity to critical business data.
- **Mail Report**: Automatically generates and sends weekly email reports to users, summarizing key metrics and insights to keep them informed about the relationship between their business performance and data.

## Technical Insights

- **Chart Display**: Utilized **ECharts** to create interactive and responsive charts, including bar charts, pie charts, line charts, etc., enabling users to visualize complex datasets effectively.
- **Table Functions**: Build multi-functional and easy-to-use table based on **Vue3 Easy Data Table** package, supporting features like sorting, filtering, and pagination to enhance data management capabilities.
- **State Management**: Leveraged Pinia for efficient state management, ensuring a predictable and maintainable state for user permissions, search conditions and shared data across the application.
- **Component Library**: Developed a reusable component library using **Storybook**, promoting consistency and efficiency in UI development and documentation and assisting other developers in understanding and utilizing components effectively.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Libraries Selection:

- **Challenge**: There are numerous libraries available for charting and table functionalities, making it difficult to select the ones that best meet the project's requirements for interactivity, performance, and ease of integration.
- **Solution**: Deeply collaborated with designers and backend engineers to understand the specific needs of the project. Conducted a thorough evaluation of various libraries, considering factors such as feature set, community support, and compatibility with Vue and TypeScript.

### Component Management:

- **Challenge**: As the project grew, managing and maintaining a large number of components became increasingly complex, leading to potential inconsistencies and inefficiencies in the development process.
- **Solution**: Hold regular code reviews and established clear guidelines for component creation and usage. Utilized Storybook to document and test components, making it easier for developers to find and reuse existing components.

### Team Allocation:

- **Challenge**: The project timeline was tight, and with a small team of 2 frontend developers, it was challenging to allocate resources effectively to meet deadlines without compromising on quality.
- **Solution**: Listed all features before development began, breaking them down into manageable tasks. Assigned tasks based on the urgency and each developer's time, ensuring a balanced workload, and update and adjust the plan regularly with the project manager.

## Outcome

- Launched the Data Warehouse feature from flow charts and prototypes to production within 4 months, enabling over 300 merchants to visualize sales trends and contributing to a 15% increase in plan fee.
- Strengthened skills in collaboration with frontend developers to ensure code quality and consistency. Utilized modern tools like Storybook to reduce the time cost by 30% when developing and documenting components.
- Gained experience in transforming complex e-commerce data into clear, actionable charts and tables, involving close collaboration with designers and backend engineers.

The Data Warehouse project provided valuable experience in building a complex web application that launched and used by a lot of clients operated in a production environment, enhancing my technical skills and teamwork abilities in a real-world setting.
