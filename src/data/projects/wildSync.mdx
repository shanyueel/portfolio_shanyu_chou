## Key Features

- **User Management**: Allow user to register, login, and manage their personal profile, including basic information, avatar, and cover image.
- **Personal Page**: Showcase user's personal information and avatar, listing out activities they created, joined or liked for other users to view.
- **Activity List**: Users can browse a list of all available activities. They can also search for specific activities based on keywords, activity type, location, and date.
- **Activity Page**: Each activity has its dedicated page displaying detailed information, including activity details, additional memos, and a list of attendees.
- **User Interactions**: Users can create or join interesting activities, and leave activities they previously joined. They can also like activities for later reference.


## Technical Insights

- **Frontend components**: Built with **React** for a dynamic and responsive user interface, allowing components to be reused and managed efficiently.
- **Firebase Solution**: Utilized **Firebase** for authentication, database, and hosting, securing user management and enabling data synchronization with Firestore's APIs.
- **State Management**: Implemented **Redux** for efficient state management, enabling predictable state transitions and maintaining single source of truth for important and frequently accessed data.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work well on a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Deployment**: Deployed the application on **GitHub Pages** and provided a test account in the README.md file, ensuring easy access for users worldwide.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Product Management:

- **Challenge**: Being too ambitious and trying to get everything perfect at once caused the schedule to be delayed again and again.
- **Solution**: Apply the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** principle by modularizing and prioritizing all features based on their strategic importance and business value. This allows for a swift initial launch, followed by an iterative process of rolling out the remaining functionalities as well-planned modules.

### Backend Database:

- **Challenge**: The project required a secure and real-time backend. Building one from scratch was not feasible for a solo developer aiming for rapid delivery.
- **Solution**: Leveraged **Firebase** services (Authentication, Firestore) to build a full-stack web application with secure user management and real-time data synchronization. Gained experience in designing the database schema and structuring data by following Firebase official guidelines.

### Global State:

- **Challenge**: To display user information and authentication status across multiple pages, managing state with React Context API led to excessive prop drilling and redundant Firestore reads.
- **Solution**: Introduced **Redux** to set different stores for managing global state, reducing prop drilling and cutting redundant Firestore reads. This resulted in a leaner data flow and easier debugging.

## Outcome

- Successfully delivered an end-to-end project within a 3-month timeframe, covering the entire development lifecycle from initial concept to final deployment. This experience provided a holistic understanding of product development.
- By single-handedly managing the roles of product manager, designer, and developer, the experience not only strengthened my respective technical skills but also enabled me to foster more effective team collaboration and communication with different roles.
- Proficiently acquired and applied new technologies and tools (e.g., Firebase, Redux) to develop efficient and effective solutions. This further honed my ability to quickly learn and adapt within dynamic development environments.

This project strengthened my product thinking and full‑stack thinking (data modeling, auth flows, optimistic updates), while showcasing my ability to scope, build, and launch a complete web application independently.
