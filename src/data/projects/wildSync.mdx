# Introduction

WildSync is a social platform designed to connect outdoor enthusiasts. It allows users to plan activities, discover new adventures, and meet like-minded people who share a passion for the outdoors.

## Key Features

- **User Management**: Allow user to register, login, and manage their personal profile, including basic information, avatar, and cover image.
- **Personal Page**: Showcase user's personal information and avatar, listing out activities they created, joined or liked for other users to view.
- **Activity List**: Users can browse a list of all available activities. They can also search for specific activities based on keywords, activity type, location, and date.
- **Activity Page**: Each activity has its dedicated page displaying detailed information, including activity details, additional memos, and a list of attendees.
- **User Interactions**: Users can create or join interesting activities, and leave activities they previously joined. They can also like activities for later reference.


## Technical Insights

- **Frontend components**: Built with React for a dynamic and responsive user interface, allowing components to be reused and managed efficiently.
- **Firebase Solution**: Utilized Firebase for authentication, database, and hosting, securing user management and enabling data synchronization with Firestore's APIs.
- **State Management**: Implemented Redux for efficient state management, enabling predictable state transitions and maintaining single source of truth for important and frequently accessed data.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work well on a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **State Management**:
  - **Challenge**: React Context API was not sufficient for managing complex state interactions, especially with user authentication and activity data.
  - **Solution**: Learned and leveraged Redux to manage the application state, ensuring a consistent and predictable state across the application.
- **Complex Data Fetching**:
  - **Challenge**: The data for the activities list could be large, leading to performance issues and slow load times.
  - **Solution**: Implemented optimized data fetching strategies, including pagination and selective data loading, to improve performance and user experience.
- **Deployment**:
  - **Challenge**: Ensuring the application is reliably deployed and accessible to users across the world.
  - **Solution**: Successfully deployed the application on Github Page, making it easy to access for all users.

## Outcome

- Introduced Redux to replace React Context API, reducing prop drilling and cutting redundant Firestore reads (leaner data flow, easier debugging).
- Applied Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Hosting) to build a full-stack web application with secure user management and real-time data synchronization.
- Implemented pagination and selective field querying to keep initial activity list lightweight and responsive.
- Built a responsive UI system (desktop / tablet / mobile) using Styled Components + Sass utilities.
- Deployed to GitHub Pages with a reproducible build pipeline, demonstrating end‑to‑end delivery capability.

This project strengthened my full‑stack thinking (data modeling, auth flows, optimistic updates) and showcases my ability to scope, build, and launch a complete web application independently.
