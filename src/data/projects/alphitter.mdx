## Key Features

### User Features:

- **Authentication**: Users can sign up for a new account or log in to an existing one.
- **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile page displaying their tweets, replies, and liked tweets.
- **Profile Editing**: Users can edit their personal information, including name, introduction, avatar, and background image.
- **Tweeting & Engagement**: Users can create & post new tweets. They can also reply to and like tweets from other users.
- **Following System**: Users can follow and unfollow other users to customize their social network.
- **Timeline**: The main page displays a timeline of all users' tweets.

### Admin Features:

- **Independent Entry**: A separate login and web page for administrators to manage the platform.
- **Tweet Management**: Administrators can view all tweets posted by users and have the ability to delete any tweet.
- **User Management**: Administrators can view a list of all registered users on the platform.

## Technical Insights

- **Component Architecture**: Extracted reusable <b>React</b> components from design draft to ensure consistency and maintainability.
- **Clean Styling**: Used <b>Styled Components</b> for modular and reusable CSS-in-JS styling in React components.
- **State Management**: Managed complex state across multiple components using <b>React's Context API</b>.
- **API Integration**: Used <b>Axios</b> to handle HTTP requests to the backend server for user authentication, tweet management, and profile updates.
- **Routing**: Implemented <b>React Router</b> for navigation between different pages and user profiles.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Remote Collaboration:

- **Challenge**: Our team members live in different locations and have varying schedules, which makes it difficult to hold frequent meetings to discuss project details.
- **Solution**: We leveraged messaging apps and adopted <b>Agile development</b> practices, including online stand-ups to align on progress and blockers, and weekly sprint planning to ensure timely delivery. This approach proved effective, as it allowed us to stay updated and make the most of our limited meeting time.

### Backend API Document:

- **Challenge**: Since the delivery schedule was tight, the frontend engineers couldn’t afford to wait for the backend team to complete the API features before starting development.
- **Solution**: We collaborated closely with the backend engineers to create a shared API specification using <b>Postman</b>. This allowed us to align on the API endpoints, request/response formats, and error handling before development began. With the API document, the frontend team could start development parallel with the backend team, significantly reducing wait times and ensuring smoother integration later on.

## Outcome

- Delivered a responsive front-end with ~18 reusable React components, reducing style/markup duplication by ~35%.
- Established a shared API spec (Postman collection), enabling frontend to start ~3 days earlier than original plan.
- Implemented Context-based state to remove >20 prop-drilling paths and simplify maintenance.

> Alphitter strengthened my React component design, state management, and API integration collaboration skills, improving my ability to work in a multi-role team environment.
