# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a **high-level programming language** that's essential for building interactive websites. It's used for things like animations, form validation, API requests, and more!

## Key Features

- Runs in the browser
- Event-driven and asynchronous
- Powers frontend and backend (Node.js)

## Simple Examples

**Variables:**

```javascript
let name = "Alice";
const age = 25;
var country = "USA";
```

**Functions:**

```javascript
function greet(user) {
  return `Hello, ${user}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Bob"));
```

**Conditionals:**

```javascript
if (age > 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}
```
