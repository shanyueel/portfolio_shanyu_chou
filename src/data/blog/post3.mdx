# Intro to React

**React** is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It makes it easy to create interactive UIs by using a component-based approach.

## Why Use React?

- **Reusable components** save time and make code cleaner
- **Virtual DOM** makes updates faster
- **Strong community** and tons of tools

## Your First React Component

Let's create a simple "Hello, World!" component:

```jsx
import React from "react"

function HelloWorld() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
}

export default HelloWorld
```

## Setting Up a Project (with Vite)

```shell
# Create a new React project with Vite
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react

cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Core Concepts to Learn

- **JSX**: JavaScript + XML syntax
- **Props**: Passing data into components
- **State**: Managing local component data

Stay curious, and happy coding! ðŸŽ¯
