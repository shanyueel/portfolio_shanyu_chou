# Next.js Personal Website Theme

This is a custom personal website theme built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It’s designed as a minimal,
performance-focused starting point for showcasing your **work**, **writing**, and **projects**.

> **Note:** This theme is generally aimed at developers and designers who want to create a personal website
> quickly and easily. Yes, I'm aware there are many other templates and themes available—_you can literally find
> them all over the internet_. The personal goal of building this theme was to get familiar
> with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and improve skills in **React** and **TypeScript**.
> I also wanted to create a starter template for myself, since none of the existing templates met my exact design and
> functionality needs, without requiring extensive modifications. So...here we are! Feel free to use this as a starting
> point for your own personal website, or as a reference for doing the same thing I did: _building your own custom
> theme!_

## 🧱 Project Structure

The site is organized around the following main routes/pages:

- 🏠 **Home** – `/`
- 💼 **Work** – `/work`
- 🛠️ **Projects** – `/projects`
- ✍️ **Blog** – `/blog`

Each page is intentionally _simple_ and _clean_, making it easy to customize and build upon.

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the

## ▲ Deployment

The fastest way to deploy this app is
via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) —
the platform made by the creators of Next.js.

For more detailed instructions, check out
the [Next.js deployment guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying).

> **Note:** This does not mean you _have_ to use Vercel. You can deploy this app on any platform that supports
> Node.js, such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), [Render](https://render.com),
> [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), or much more. Even [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is
> a viable option, but it requires the use of a static export,
> see [Next.js docs for that](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/deploying#static-export).
